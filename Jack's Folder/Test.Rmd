```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Load the libraries
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(paletteer)
library(janitor)
```


```{r}
read.csv("~/Desktop/BIS15W2025_group7/sleep_cycle_productivity.csv")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
